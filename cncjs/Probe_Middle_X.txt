; Middle probing for X:
;   * Probe and set zero on the right side of the object being probed
;   * Jog to position the spindle to the left side of the object being
;     probed and close to the object
;   * Run this macro which will touch the object and then set a new zero
;
; Note: If your probe has an offset (e.g. using the spindle itself with 6mm
;       dowel, you don't want to include that in the original zero as it will
;       simply cancel itself out with the second zeroing).
