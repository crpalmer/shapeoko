On a new machine:

git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
cd ~/.nvm
git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`

Add this to .bashrc.crpalmer if it's not there:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

nvm install 14.21.1
nvm install -g yarn

and then you should be able to build it easily with:

yarn install
yarn build-prod

and then run it with

node bin/cncjs # -p 8080

If you have problems with device not staying connected with dmesg errors:

ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0

then run

sudo apt remove brltty
